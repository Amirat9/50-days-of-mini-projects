## Project Description

The third day's project is focused on creating a rotating navigation menu. This project demonstrates how to build an interactive and visually appealing navigation menu that rotates in and out of view when a button is clicked.

## Key Features

- **Rotating Navigation:** The navigation menu rotates into view when activated and hides when deactivated.
