# Day 01: Expandable Cards

## Project Description

The first day's project is focused on creating multiple expandable cards. Each card transitions smoothly to a larger size when clicked. This project demonstrates the use of higher-order functions like `forEach` to add event listeners and manipulate class names dynamically.

## Key Features

- **Expandable Cards:** Clicking on a card expands it to a larger size with a smooth transition.
- **Dynamic Class Manipulation:** Utilized `forEach` to add event listeners and dynamically add/remove class names.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Employed CSS Flexbox to arrange the cards responsively.
- **CSS Properties:** Explored border-radius, opacity, and positioning (relative and absolute).
- **Background Images:** Learned how to effectively add and style background images for the cards.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the card elements.
- **CSS:** Styling the cards using Flexbox, border-radius, opacity, and positioning.
- **JavaScript:** Adding interactive functionality with event listeners and class manipulation.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with CSS Flexbox for layout management.
- Practiced using JavaScript higher-order functions like `forEach`.
- Improved understanding of CSS properties like border-radius, opacity, and positioning.
- Learned to add and style background images effectively.
