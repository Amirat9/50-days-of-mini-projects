## About the Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to improve my skills in front-end development by building small, focused projects each day. Each project will be created from scratch, and I'll document my learning process and challenges faced along the way.

## Credits

This challenge is inspired by and follows the 50 Days of Mini Projects course by Traversy Media. Special thanks to Brad Traversy for his excellent tutorials and resources.

## How to Use
