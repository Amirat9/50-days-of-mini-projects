# Day 02: Interactive Progress Bar

## Project Description

The second day's project is an interactive progress bar. This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic and visually appealing progress bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The progress bar updates as users interact with it, showcasing various stages of progress.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Progress Bar:** The progress bar updates dynamically based on user interaction.
- **Pseudo Classes:** Utilized CSS pseudo-classes like `:before`, `:active`, and `:focus` to style elements effectively.
- **JavaScript Array Methods:** Employed the `forEach` method to traverse through an array of active circles and update their status.
- **CSS Transitions:** Applied smooth transitions for a better user experience.
- **Transformations:** Used CSS `translate` for positioning elements dynamically.
- **Custom Variables:** Implemented CSS custom properties (variables) for cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the progress bar and interactive elements.
- **CSS:** Styling the progress bar with pseudo-classes, transitions, and custom variables.
- **JavaScript:** Adding functionality to update the progress bar dynamically.

## Learning Outcomes

- Mastered the use of CSS pseudo-classes for advanced styling techniques.
- Gained proficiency in using JavaScript array methods like `forEach` for DOM manipulation.
- Improved understanding of CSS transitions and transformations for smooth animations.
- Learned to implement CSS custom variables for better code organization.
